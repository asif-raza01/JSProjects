//earlier there were SOAP APIs but they slow and heavy why beacause they used XML which contaions a lot of meta data along with valuable data
//REST => Represtational State Transfer
//so REST APIs came in picture they were flexible  fast able to use different formats eg JSON no heavy data 
//stateful means it remembers the states so it is fast but but it is a single point failure possibility
//stateless it keeps track of states of remembers them specifically scalable 
//idempotent APIs get/put/delete only works one if you make get request it will give the same item
//non idempotent post because at every call generation of new object takes place
//URI uniform resource identifier uniquely identifies
//URL unifrom resource locator domain name that we use example facebook.com
