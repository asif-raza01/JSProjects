instead of using native programming language directly we use something called framework to 
1.maintain minimum code quality so that diffetrent people can understand it better 
2.to maintain project structure
3.to facilitate easy collabration
4.boiler plate code can be avoided 

so to build restful apis we use express a web framework for nodejs
1.It is flexible
2.It is light weight
3.It is simple
4.routing,middleware,http handling become super simple
